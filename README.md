## Installation

Firstly, install Docker and docker-compose ([see the official Docker docs](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)) on the system you want to run this app on.

After that use `download.sh` script (located in the project root directory) and edit the `DEST_BASE_PATH` variable inside this file, so that a path corresponds with the actual location on your file system.

Running the script will download files essential to run the app.
* environment-specific docker-compose file
* .env containing services configuration

Edit `.env` configuration variables with your values.

Then transfer the directory to the server. You can use this command template:
```
scp -r DOWNLOADED_DIR USER@SERVER:APP_DIR -i PRIVATE_KEY_FILE_PATH
```

In the server app directory start all the services using this command:
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.ENV.yml up -d
```

The command will start the services listed below:
* Postgres - database
* Adminer - database manager
* Server - app server
* Web â€“ app client

To populate the database with initial data, the command below must be run inside the `server` container.
```node
npm run seed
```

## Developers installation
Create a `.env` configuration file inspired by `.env.example`.

The docker-compose configuration file to use for the development is called `docker-compose.local.yml`.
Start all the services with the command below:
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.local.yml up -d
```

Source code directories and `package.json` are mapped as volumes in the corresponding container file system.

To populate the local database with initial data, the command below must be run inside the `server` container.
```node
npm run seed:local
```

## Services update
To update services run these commands in the server app directory:
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.ENV.yml pull [SERVICE]
docker-compose -f docker-compose.ENV.yml up -d --force-recreate --build [SERVICE]
docker image prune -f
```
It may be necessary to update `.env` variables before running the commands above.
