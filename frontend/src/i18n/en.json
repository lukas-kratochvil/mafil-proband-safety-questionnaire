The collected data will not be evaluated by a doctor, but by a scientist. In the event that a researcher suspects possible health complications, you have the right to be informed about this suspicion and subsequently to consult a doctor about the suspicion, which would be ensured by the researcher of the relevant study based on your informed consent decision."

The principle of the method is to monitor the behavior of tissues and organs in a very strong magnetic field. The measurement is accompanied by increased noise. The examination is not painful, but electronics or metal material in the body or on its surface can damage your health due to the magnetic field. Therefore, from the safety point of view, it is very important to follow the instructions of the MR device operator and to fill out the following questionnaire truthfully. If you have any questions or ambiguities, please contact the operator of the MR device.",
