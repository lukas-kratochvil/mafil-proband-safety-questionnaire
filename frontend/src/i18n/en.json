        "text1": "Welcome to the magnetic resonance (MR) workplace. It is a modern imaging method used in medicine, which, unlike X-ray examination, does not use ionizing radiation. The principle of the method is to monitor the behavior of tissues and organs in a very strong magnetic field. The measurement is accompanied by increased noise. The examination is not painful, but electronics or metal material in the body or on its surface can damage your health due to the magnetic field. Therefore, from the safety point of view, it is very important to follow the instructions of the MR device operator and to fill out the following questionnaire truthfully. If you have any questions or ambiguities, please contact the operator of the MR device.",
